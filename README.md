# Armadillo
## What?
A REPL for (almost) anything

## How?
### Quickstart
% armadillo [-cmd foo] [-path path/to/directory]

- Without specifying a `-path` argument, `armadillo` defaults to the currently opened directory.
- Without specifying a `-cmd` argument, `armadillo will try to guess what you want a REPL for. This is currently limited to `mercurial`, `svn`, and `git` repositories.

## Why?
[Automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/) that [probably isn't worth the time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) but is still fun.
